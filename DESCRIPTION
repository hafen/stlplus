Description: Decompose a time series into seasonal, trend, and remainder
    components using an implementation of Seasonal Decomposition of Time
    Series by Loess (STL) that provides several enhancements over the STL
    method in the stats package.  These enhancements include handling missing
    values, providing higher order (quadratic) loess smoothing with automated
    parameter choices, frequency component smoothing beyond the seasonal and
    trend components, and some basic plot methods for diagnostics.
